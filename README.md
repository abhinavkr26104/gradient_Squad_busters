# **Sleep Apnea Prediction Tool**  
ðŸŒ™ A Machine Learning-based application to predict sleep apnea and classify its severity using Polysomnography (PSG) data in EDF format.

[ðŸ‘‰ **Live Demo**](https://sleep-disorder-ml-project.streamlit.app/)

---

## **Overview**  
This tool utilizes advanced Machine Learning models to process respiratory and EEG signals, estimate sleep time, detect apnea/hypopnea events, and classify sleep apnea severity. It is designed to assist researchers and clinicians in analyzing sleep disorders efficiently.

---

## **Key Features**  

### 1. **Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) Prediction**  
Predicts the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) based on PSG data.

### 2. **Sleep Apnea Classification**  
Classifies sleep apnea severity into:
- **No Sleep Apnea**  
- **Mild Sleep Apnea**  
- **Moderate Sleep Apnea**  
- **Severe Sleep Apnea**

### 3. **Event Detection**  
Detects respiratory events such as **apnea** and **hypopnea** from PSG signals.

### 4. **Sleep Time Estimation**  
Estimates total sleep time using EEG delta band power.

---

## **How It Works**  

### **Signals Processed**
- **Respiratory (oro-nasal airflow)**: Detects apnea and hypopnea events.  
- **EEG (Fpz-Cz)**: Estimates sleep time by analyzing delta band (0.5â€“4 Hz) power.

### **Models Used**
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Predicts AHI from respiratory and EEG features (`rf_regressor.pkl`).  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Classifies sleep apnea severity (`best_svm.pkl`).  

---

## **Data Source**  
We use the [PhysioNet Sleep-EDF Expanded Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/), a publicly available collection of PSG recordings.

---

## **Performance Metrics**  
The SVM model achieves outstanding performance:  

- **Cross-validation Accuracy Scores**:  
  `[0.947, 0.789, 0.946, 0.946, 0.919]`  
- **Mean Accuracy**:  
  `90.95%`
